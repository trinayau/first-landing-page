        City dwellers might have small spaces but they certainly have big
        hearts. Not every dog will be suitable for urban life, so it's important
        to find out which breed best suits you and your lifestyle!

          A city is a place <br />where there is no need to wait <br />for next
          week to get the answer to a question,<br />
          to taste the food of any country, <br />to find new voices to listen
          to <br />and familiar ones to listen to again. <br />
          ‚Äî Margaret Mead

    <p class="about-miya">
      Life in the city can be dazzling, exciting and certainly something to
      yearn for. Once you are here however, you might find yourself alone
      surrounded by millions of people. Sometimes all you need is one friend by
      your side, whether they have 2 hands or 4 paws. <br /><br />
      That's where <strong>Miya</strong> comes in, connecting like-minded city
      dwellers with a penchant for snuffly noses and big puppy dog eyes. Adopt
      an older dog or find a reputable breeder for your newest member of the
      family, find pet-friendly apartments and meet up with other cool dog
      owners. Look forward to expanding your circle of fluffy friends and human
      bros at our city-exclusive dog-friendly events.
      <br />
      <br />
      Think: dog yoga, puppy brunches, group training sessions and more! All
      coming to a city near you very soon.
